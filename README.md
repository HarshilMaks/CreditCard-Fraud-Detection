# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant financial crime that affects consumers and institutions worldwide. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions. The goal is to enhance fraud detection accuracy and reduce financial losses.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Implement supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Visualization of key results and insights.
